Send comments about the writing to Xibo\\nat xibo@fido.econ.arizona.edu.\\n\\nBy: xibo@fido.econ.arizona.edu (Mr. Coates)\\nDate: 9 Apr 92 18:41:49 GMT\\nOrganization: Xibological Perimeter\\n\\n\\nSeveral months ago, a few angst-list members were mulling over the idea of\\nAngstCon III, where to have it, and when.  It became quickly apparent that if\\nwe held it in Minneapolis, then the turnout would be pretty good, since five\\nof the members live in that area.  So a few arrangements were made, the date\\ndebated wildly, and eventually the weekend of March 27th was decided upon.\\n\\nI decided that since I was going to fly all the way out to Minneapolis from my\\nhumble abode in Tucson, I might as well see other parts of the midwest as\\nwell.  Utilizing my knowledge that round-trip tickets don\\'t have to be with\\nthe same city, I chose to visit Chicago, because it\\'s a big famous city that\\nI\\'ve never been to before.  All I had to do was arrange to get from Chicago\\nto Minneapolis on my own, via bus or with a friend.\\n\\nAs it happened, I was able to convince Pope_751 to drive down from Milwau-\\nkee, pick me up in Chicago, take me to Purdue for a couple days, and then\\ndrive me to Milwaukee, where I would meet up with another friend, Markian\\nGooley, who would then take me to Minneapolis, where I would do the\\nAngstCon thing and then fly back home.\\n\\nThe overall adventure took nine days, from Friday, March 20th to Sunday,\\nMarch 29th.  I planned to take a week off from work, but made no official\\narrangements with the department secretary, as I was rather displeased with\\nhaving to work panic-level hours for a couple weeks, getting the RS/6000s\\nback on their feet after they had been decimated by IBM\\'s kludge-filled AIX\\n3.2 upgrade.  If you are considering doing this upgrade on your RS/6000,\\nDON\\'T.  If you are looking to hire someone who has experience managing\\nRS/6000s, please hire me, I\\'m very underpaid currently.\\n\\nSo, armed with airplane tickets, ride plans, and contingency plans, I ventured\\nforth on my adventure into the great midwest.  What follows is a short\\nsummary of my travels, along with some of the observations I made at the\\ntime.\\n\\n<page break>\\n\\nFriday, March 20th\\n\\n\\nAfter two weeks of pure hell, the RS/6000s were rescued, and the laboratory\\nhad almost returned to business as usual.  It was amazing that I was able to\\nclear things up in that time, and leave for vacation with a clear conscience.\\nCasually I packed my luggage, one really big suitcase with a week\\'s worth of\\nclothes and my camera, and my briefcase for carry-on entertainment, and\\n\"maps\".  These maps, for the most part, consisted of text descriptions of how\\nto get here and there, which I had received via email.  For entertainment I\\nput the day\\'s Wall Street Journal, my Game Boy (with Final Fantasy Legend II\\ncartridge), and a paperback novel, \"The Difference Engine\" by Gibson and\\nSterling.\\n\\nIt was a calm, sunny day, near 70, as I drove to the airport. I managed to get\\nmy car parked at the $2/day long-term parking area, check into the airport,\\nand find my gate, all with no difficulty.  I was really early so I treated\\nmyself to an expensive breakfast at the main restaurant in the airport.\\n\\nThe flight to Chicago was non-stop, and only about three hours, which I\\nthought was really short.  It was a fairly modern plane, with phones in the\\nback of the seats.  For $2.00 per minute, you could make a phone call from\\n30,000 feet.  I was tempted to call my brother and tell him I was talking to\\nhim from a few miles in the air, but I decided against it.\\n\\nBy some really strange act of fate, we flew over the Very Large Array.  The\\npilot was pointing it out so that the people on the other side of the plane\\ncould see it.  A few minutes after passing that, I looked down on the ground\\non my side of the plane, and saw a most amazing sight: Socorro, New Mexico,\\nhome of New Mexico Tech, where I went to college and suffered much angst\\nand mental anguish.  The college, which only has 1300 students, looked really\\nsmall.  I could see \"M\" mountain, the whole city, the Rio Grande, the explosive\\ntest sites... all at once, and it was quite miniature.  It was comforting to know\\nthat I had risen so far above all that.\\n\\nIt didn\\'t take long to reach Chicago, touching down at O\\'Hare airport.  I\\'d\\nnever been there before, but I knew it was supposed to be pretty big.  At\\nthe gate, I looked around, but could see no sign of Wanderer.  Damn, I\\nthought, I sure hope he isn\\'t late.  He\\'s the only person I knew in Chicago.\\nSo I stood around for a couple minutes, making sure he wasn\\'t there, and\\nthen I proceeded to the baggage claim area, making sure he wasn\\'t at the\\nsecurity checkpoint site, which was pretty big and partitioned off and\\nconfusing.  He wasn\\'t at the baggage claim area either, and my suitcase\\nquickly arrived.  So I looked around, confused, trying to figure out what to\\ndo.  I called his house and left a message on his answering machine, but that\\ndidn\\'t really cheer me up much.  Finally, I decided that there was little I\\ncould really do, and I sat down and read some for a while.  A few minutes\\nlater Wanderer runs in, explaining he\\'s been waiting right outside, in a line of\\n40 cars, and he was expecting me to walk out of the area and see him\\ninstantly.  Yeah, right, I thought.  All this just so we wouldn\\'t have to walk\\nto a parking area.  *sigh*\\n\\nSo I resolved to write up an airport protocol, in the hopes that in the future,\\npeople everywhere would use the protocol, and no more confusion would have\\nto be suffered.  [See Appendix B]\\n\\nWe drove off, doing smalltalk about the weather, and freeways, and before we\\nknew it we drove under a plane.  It was the first time for both of us.  How it\\nhappens is that O\\'Hare, like DFW, is so big that the freeway separates some of\\nthe landing strips from the gates, so there is a heavy-duty bridge the\\nairplanes taxi over, to cross the freeway.  Thus, with some lucky timing, you\\ncan drive underneath an airplane.\\n\\nTraffic was a bit congested, as it was rush hour by this time, so when the\\nBurger King on top of the Freeway came into view, which I thought was a\\ncrazy place to put a Burger King, we exited and hid there for a while.  There\\nwere arcade games, including my favorite, Smash TV.  So we pumped a few\\nquarters into the machine and won big money, big prizes (I even won a toast-\\ner!).  Then we killed more time by actually ordering some food.\\n\\nWanderer\\'s place was actually in a distant suburb, and the streets began to\\nhave familiar names.  I was told that this was normal, as the suburbs of Los\\nAngeles, Chicago, and New York City all connect, and we were currently\\nsomewhere in Utah.  I nodded, wishing I had known this before, as I would\\nhave just driven instead of flying.\\n\\nI got to meet the cats, Boris and Rigel, both of which were very playful\\ncritters.  Wanderer showed me his lovely abode, a nine foot square cardboard\\nbox that leaned against a supermarket.  (It did have net-access, though.)\\n\\nAfter settling in, meeting one of his roommates and cute asian friend, we\\nheaded back out into the cold night of Chicago.  The skyline was simply\\nawe-inspiring, but unlike New York City, you could actually drive around\\nwithout delays.  We stopped to get some power steering fluid for the car,\\nwhich was screeching a lot.  My friend hadn\\'t thought to do this before, as\\ncar maintenance isn\\'t one of his strong points.\\n\\nThe view of the Sears Tower at night was really impressive. Strangely, it\\ndidn\\'t look as mind-boggingly tall as I had hoped; this may have been due to\\nseveral nearby buildings being almost as tall. Still, with the night lights, it all\\nlooked very modern.\\n\\nWe drove past downtown and on towards another person\\'s apartment, where\\npicked up someone else, and then we headed back downtown to go play Battle-\\nTech.  This was a stripped-down version of Mech Warrior that had been\\nreprogrammed to allow several players at once, using a network using\\nLANtastic and run on 286es.  We made several sniggering comments on how\\nprimitive the hardware was, and then played a couple games.  The games were\\nvery expensive ($8) and only lasted a few minutes. The selling point was\\nvirtual reality, which is to say that they sit you in a box that blocks out\\nexternal light, so all you see is several buttons and switches that do things\\nonly advanced players can guess at, a couple hand and foot controls, and the\\nviewscreen.  I guess if one wasn\\'t aware of all the simple software tricks\\ninvolved, it might have looked impressive.  But personally I thought it was\\nreally lacking.\\n\\nAfter that we cruised through downtown streets that were made by famous by\\nthe movie, \"The Blues Brothers\".  That was entertaining, and then we stopped\\nby the Sears Tower so I could take some pictures of it from up close.  We\\ncouldn\\'t get in, for it was closed by that time. A persuasive black man tried\\nvery hard to sell us some gold chains; he was rather insistent, but I just\\nblew him off entirely.  The others actually tried to talk him away.\\n\\nAfter dropping off Wanderer\\'s friend, we drove back, discussing along the\\nway several ideas on how to improve on the BattleTech idea, how to rip it off\\nentirely, and how to make a much better product. Sometimes, even now, I\\nthink about getting a few people together, and building a simulation involving\\nspace dogfights, but it would require about $50,000 investment to start.\\n\\nSo I just laid down on the couch and let cats walk over me all night long.\\n\\n<page break>\\n\\nSaturday, March 21st\\n\\n\\nWhen I woke up, there was snow on the ground.  And it was falling lightly.\\nWanderer was still quite asleep, but I didn\\'t feel at all tired anymore, so I\\nplayed with the cats for a while.  They were really cute, fun things.  I\\'d\\nnever get one, though; you have to feed them regularly and clean their litter\\nboxes and that\\'s just too much of a hassle for me.\\n\\nI just laid there for a long time, and pretended to be asleep, and watched one\\nof the roommate\\'s girls leave, and then come back an hour later or so, as if to\\npretend she hadn\\'t spent the night there. \"That\\'s odd...\" I thought, and\\nshrugged.\\n\\nSo I pulled out my Game Boy and vegetated to that for a couple hours.  It\\'s\\nnot an exciting game, it\\'s not even a good game.  But it was better than\\nwatching the snow fall down.  The icicles on the pine trees were really\\nawesome, though.\\n\\nEventually though, we did get back in gear, and walked out to the car, which\\nwas covered in snow.  Actually all the cars were covered in snow, and if you\\ndidn\\'t remember where you parked you car, you had to wipe snow off cars\\nuntil you found yours, as they all looked alike, all the same size, all\\nlate-seventies boats.\\n\\nThe drive back to town was a bit of a challenge; there was ice on the roads,\\nwhich didn\\'t please me at all.  But for the most part the car stayed under\\ncontrol.  We found Wax Trax, a famous alternative record outlet, without much\\ndifficulty.  Parking was another matter, though; and when we travelled on a\\nside street, which had not been salted, the car decided not to stop at the\\nstop sign, and we slid into traffic.  Whee. Amazingly, there was no collision.\\n\\nI really do not understand how people can live in a climate like that, where\\nlosing control of the car and endangering yourself to collisions every day is\\njust a normal part of life.  It\\'s absurd!\\n\\nBut we did make it Wax Trax, and they had a very impressive selection of\\nCDs, but not as good as the Wax Trax in Denver.  Actually, I thought the\\nplace was rather small, but I did find 9 CDs worth buying there.  [See\\nAppendix A]\\n\\nSo, one of my big goals of the trip over with, I sat back in the car and\\nrelaxed, as the snowstorm got to be rather severe.  We had planned to visit\\nthe Sears Tower, but after a few minutes of driving, it became obvious that\\nthe best thing to do would be to manage to make it back to secure shelter.\\nTraffic was not pleasant, and road conditions were an unhappiness.  I even\\ngot Wanderer to admit that he didn\\'t like to drive when the weather was like\\nthis.  Gee.\\n\\nWe stopped at a grocery store and picked up a case of RC cola so we\\'d have\\nstuff to drink.  The roommates were watching \"Robin Hood\" with their girl-\\nfriends when we got back to the apartment.  I ordered some pizza from Pizza\\nHut, and got chewed out by the roommates for not getting real Chicago-style\\npizza.  Fuck \\'em, I thought.  I wanted pizza, and I didn\\'t want to risk having\\nit be weird.  Pizza Hut is the same no matter what part of the country you\\'re\\nin.\\n\\nAfter the movie they put in \"City Slickers\".  This was a very good movie; I\\ndidn\\'t get a chance to see it when it was showing in the theaters.  When it\\nwas over, I thought about it, and decided that my trip to the midwest was\\nkind of like a reverse of the movie\\'s concept. I\\'m from the desert southwest,\\nand I\\'m spending my vacation visiting highly urban cities.  So if there\\'s a\\nterm for the reverse of a city slicker, then that would describe me on this\\ntrip.\\n\\n<page break>\\n\\nSunday, March 22nd\\n\\n\\nSo after another morning of being walked up on by cats, vegging out to Game\\nBoy, and contemplating the weather, things picked up again. We did the food\\nthing, eating out at Arby\\'s.  Wanderer drove in circles in the parking lot five\\nor six times, because he was bored.\\n\\nI was finally able to contact Pope_751, and convinced him to drive to Chicago\\nand pick me up.  Then it simply became a matter of killing the day off,\\nbecause he needed to sleep first.\\n\\nSo, what better way to kill time than to preview OS/2 2.0?  A copy of one of\\nthe latest beta releases was on hand, so I got to play with it for a couple\\nhours.  Overall, it was much better in appearance than Windows 3.0, which\\nimpressed me, as IBM has a habit of making a lot of hype about things that\\nare actually just so-so.  But this is actually a better product than Windows,\\nso I think IBM might actually have something here.  Problem is, you need a\\n386 and about six megs of RAM to run it effectively.  Most people have a 386\\nby now though, and it shouldn\\'t be long before people clue in to the concept\\nof buying more RAM.\\n\\nStill, I\\'d rather run UNIX.  Even AIX, which is evil and buggy and had a\\ndisastrous upgrade recently that caused me a lot of grief. I just don\\'t think\\nhaving a cute graphical interface hiding command line prompts is enough\\nreason to justify suffering all that overhead in making a multi-tasking\\nDOS-compatible system.  But, oh well.\\n\\nWanderer had to take off to do some urgent work, so I was left to play with\\nthe computer and get in some net time, catching up with email and doing a\\nlittle mudding.  While I was mudding, I heard some sounds behind me, and I\\nturned around to see a large iguana climbing the closet door.\\n\\nI stared at the iguana.  It stared back at me.  I nodded at it and went on\\ntyping away at the computer.  It went on climbing the closet door.  There was\\nbalance in the universe.\\n\\nSo, the computer thing got old after a while.  It got dark. I read some out of\\nthe novel I brought along, then vegged out some more to Game Boy.  It wasn\\'t\\nthe most exciting time, but it wasn\\'t particularly stressful either, and pretty\\nrelaxing compared to my normal life.\\n\\nBut alas, it had to happen, Pope_751 finally did arrive,  driving a (Surprise!)\\nlate-seventies boat.  We loaded the car and took off.  His car a had a totally\\nawesome sound system, it was capable picking up frequencies from 530 Khz to\\n1600 Khz.\\n\\nSo I became mesmerized by the sounds of talk radio and we drove in circles\\nin the suburbs of Chicago, looking for a freeway. On the second time around\\nwe found one, and half an hour later, past a few toll booths, we were on our\\nway to Indiana.\\n\\nWe got gas near Gary, Indiana, and coke, too.  As an added bonus, the car\\npicked up a nail, and a while later we discovered that the tire had gone flat.\\nThis was a bummer, because it was  cold outside, but we were near a rest\\narea, so we parked there and checked it out.  Simple flat, and there just\\nhappened to be a jack and a spare tire in the trunk.  What luck!\\n\\nOnly thing was, the jack was a seventies-style thing, that had to be assem-\\nbled.  But with a little effort we got the two-ton car jacked up and the tire\\nswapped out.  Yay.  But that was all too easy, so the jack decided that it\\nliked going up, but not down. We could not convince that jack to come down.\\nIt was so old and  probably hadn\\'t been used since the seventies, so some-\\nthing stuck inside, and it wouldn\\'t go down, no matter how we banged it,\\nshifted the levers, or anything.\\n\\nI was not impressed.  \"Jack,\" I said menacingly, \"you are not going to\\nprevent me from getting to Purdue.\"  And so I told  Pope_751 to put the car\\nin neutral.  My, the jack didn\\'t like that. The car rolled right off the thing,\\ntaking a piece of bumper off with it.  We nodded and headed back on our\\nway.\\n\\n<page break>\\n\\nMonday, March 23rd\\n\\n\\nAnd so about an hour later we found our way through the dead trees and\\nancient houses to the thriving metropolis of West Lafayette, Indiana.  We\\nfollowed the fun directions that took us through a shopping center, to the\\nsecret hideout of Finrod & Tourmaline\\'s apartment.\\n\\nA lightly bearded man with really long hair answered the door and welcomed\\nus in; it was Bishop_III.  On the couch was Tank Girl, his girlfriend, who was\\nmudding away on a laptop that had been set on a chair. It was a friendly\\nwelcome, and we all gathered around Tank Girl to see what was happening on\\nthe mud.  She announced to all our friends in our favorite corner of\\ncyberspace that we had arrived.  Riana, another mudder from Purdue, heard\\nthis and said she\\'d be right over to meet us.  We all joked back and forth\\nhow Blackbird would kill her if she set foot in the apartment, as her reputa-\\ntion was not the most favorable one.  But Blackbird was elsewhere at this\\ntime, so nothing prevented her from coming on over.\\n\\nSo half an hour later Riana arrived, although she was only a fifteen minute\\nwalk away.  With her was Nilrem, her current boyfriend, and some other guy,\\nwhose name eludes me, thankfully, as he gave the appearance of a totally\\nclueless loud-mouth, which, in fact, he turned out to be.  I noticed Nilrem had\\na Battletech patch on his jacket, which I thought was cute.  The three of\\nthem looked like they were from a local high school but I was told that they\\nwere indeed college students.\\n\\nPope_751 and I were rather hungry at this point, and decided to get food,\\nalthough it was late and the best place anyone could think of to eat was\\nDenny\\'s, which was fine with me.  We took the three young\\'uns with us.  On\\nthe way there it was explained to me that the people who work at Denny\\'s\\ndon\\'t appreciate students.  Well fuck them! We were paying customers, and\\nneither Pope_751 nor I were students.\\n\\nSo I ordered eggs, because I love to eat eggs at Denny\\'s. Everyone quickly\\nordered their stuff, except for the loudmouth, he bungled his order, talking\\nconfusedly with the waitress for five or ten minutes.  I wanted to reach over\\nand kill him, stab my fork in his eyeball repeatedly.  Bastard.  Hasn\\'t he ever\\nbeen to a Denny\\'s before? Didn\\'t he know how to order food?  Christ!\\n\\nDuring the course of our meal, Riana explained to us how she found Nilrem at\\nGenCon, like a lost puppy, and took him home with her. I didn\\'t believe the\\nstory, but she stood by it, and everyone else seems to believe it\\'s true.\\nNilrem talked at length about how he was kicked out of here and there and\\nhitchhiked from place to place looking for a new home every few months.  I\\njust stared at him. Pope_751 bought a copy of USA Today and spent most of\\nthe time reading the articles.\\n\\nAfter a while, I began to realize that things were too absurd to obey the laws\\nof any normal reality, and I decided to have fun with this.  Riana was kind of\\ncute, and playful, so I asked her if she\\'d like to have sex, in a low voice,\\nwhile Nilrem was talking about something else.  I don\\'t think anyone else\\nheard, except maybe Pope_751.  She resisted this offer, making some excuse\\nabout Nilrem, so I offered to give him $20 to go entertain himself while we had\\nfun together.  I thought it was a reasonable offer, I mean hell, he could go to\\na movie and get popcorn and a drink and still have cash left over to play\\narcade games.  Riana, however, turned this down.\\n\\nMaybe I should have been more generous.\\n\\nThe sun came up and the kids began to whine about how tired they were, and\\nPope_751 decided to play the cruel part, and forced everyone to stay at\\nDenny\\'s an extra hour.  But eventually even he got bored, so we drove back\\nto the Purdue area, and dropped the kids off.  And we didn\\'t see any of them\\never again.  Yay.\\n\\nPope_751 and I cruised around campus and to the brighter parts of West\\nLafayette, until we found ourselves overlooking the splendid view of several\\nhill-sized heaps of rock that a local mill had deposited.  We sat in admiration\\nof this for a long time, it must have at least forty seconds, and then decided\\nthat this town really wasn\\'t that interesting after all, and seeked entertain-\\nment elsewhere.  This led us back to the apartment.\\n\\nBlackbird was there, doing something vaguely breakfast-like. No introductions\\nwere necessary, we all knew each so well from our respective reputations that\\nthere was simply no reason for confusion. We made several crude jokes and\\nhad a jolly good time together, a true male-bonding experience, all very macho\\nand rude.  After a while though, Blackbird had to go to some other engage-\\nment, probably a class.\\n\\nThis left us two dangerous characters alone and bored, with nothing to do.  I\\nlooked at Pope_751, he looked at me.  We looked at the newspaper.\\n\\n\"Scissors,\" I stated.\\n\\nHe nodded vigorously and thus began the search for scissors. We didn\\'t want\\nto be too obnoxious turning the apartment upside down looking for scissors,\\nbeing guests and all that.  But we really did want some scissors.  Eventually\\nI ventured upon a pair in Finrod\\'s room, and we were in business.\\n\\nWe sorted through the advertisements and cut out several pictures of young\\nwomen and girls, especially the ones wearing only underwear. I was told to\\nsearch for an ad for a douche, while Pope_751 cut up the figures into phallic\\nshapes.  By the time I found one, he had made many cute figures, mixed and\\nmatched.  If we had glue we would have made quite a collage.\\n\\nBut we didn\\'t have any glue.  And it was getting boring.  So we tried to get\\naccess, instead.  We fiddled with the computer, and managed to get it to call\\nthe university, but weren\\'t able to get either an external line or access to an\\naccount.  It was a bummer.\\n\\nFortunately around this time, Tank Girl had waken up and stumbled her way\\nout of Bishop_III\\'s bedroom.  She was able to supply a few more clues about\\nhacking into the system with Tourmaline\\'s account, but we still weren\\'t able to\\nget through.  So then she did the logical thing, she logged into her own\\naccount.  Finally, access!\\n\\nWhile she was occupied with checking her email and seeing who was on\\nDreamScape, I decided to occupy myself with fulfilling some promises and\\nthreats I had made previously, via mud, a week before. This involved fondling\\nTank Girl, groping her, and massaging her breasts.  She didn\\'t object, which\\nset off an ancient, dusty voice in the back of my head.\\n\\n\"Pursue your ambitions,\" the voice said.\\n\\nI needed no further encouragement; I went for it.  She was wearing a\\nbutton-down dress, so I started by undoing a couple buttons, so I could get\\nsome fingers through, and did some exploring.  She fidgeted a little, but I\\nkept at it anyway.  She was mudding on DreamScape by this time, telling the\\ngang how she was being molested by Xibo, and then the term \"xibolestation\"\\nappeared.\\n\\nI discovered she wasn\\'t wearing anything underneath, as my rubbing fingers\\ndiscovered pubic hair, and ventured further.  Things progressed quite freely,\\nand I found myself finger-fucking her.  I think this finally got her attention,\\nas she gave Pope_751 the controls and let him take over the computer.\\n\\nThe glasses came off, and the kissing started.  We made out on the couch,\\ngiving it reason to exist.  Pope_751 was doing the play by play, exaggerating\\nthe details a little.  I figured since everyone had heard I was molesting her, I\\nmight as well do it completely.  I sucked on her neck, we sucked face, we\\nsquirmed and thrusted.  It was a blast.\\n\\nEventually we cooled off and went back to mudding, to see just what Pope_751\\nhad told everyone.  Unfortunately no one had logged it, which was a pisser.\\nI was feeling most amused at this time, and was well beyond caring what\\nBishop_III might have done, had he woken up and walked in on us, which was\\npretty abnormal for me.  But I didn\\'t give a shit; I was on vacation, having a\\ngood time.  They were supposed to have an open relationship anyway, so I\\nchose not to worry about it. I did wonder, though, whether the people on the\\nmud believed what Pope_751 had told them.  It was all true, but rather\\nunexpected.\\n\\nTourmaline and Finrod arrived at one o\\'clock for lunch, and I finally got to\\nmeet these cool people.  Tourmaline wasn\\'t near as fat as I thought she was,\\nand Finrod wasn\\'t as pale as I was expecting, either. We sat around chatting\\nfor a while, and Tourmaline wasn\\'t at all  surprised to see Tank Girl and I\\nbeing all cuddly on the couch; my assumption at the time was that she was\\nused to strange events occurring when mudders come to visit, but on retro-\\nspect I suspect that perhaps she felt such behavior was normal for Tank Girl.\\n\\nFinrod bypassed conversation in favor of lunch.  Tourmaline showed Pope_751\\nhow to use the computer to get access, and then grabbed some quick chow for\\nherself.  I blinked my eyes and they were back out the door, promising to be\\nback later, in time for quarter night at McDonald\\'s.\\n\\nThat left our afternoon with time to kill.  Pope_751 passed out at this point,\\nbut I was still good for several hours, as staying up for thirty hours at a\\ntime was something I picked up in grad school. So this of course led to more\\nplayful xibolestation, and I grew to really admire Tank Girl\\'s curvy features.\\nI should have fun like that more often.  (At least more often than every three\\nyears, but I\\'ll not get into that here.)\\n\\nBishop_III woke up to find her bare legs in my lap, but he didn\\'t even blink,\\nhe just sat down on the couch next to us and looked over to see what was\\ngoing on the computer, with the mud.  Did he mind that Tank Girl and I were\\nso cozy?  I don\\'t think so; at least, he gave no external sign.  Lucky me.\\n\\nAround sunset I was running out of motivation to stay awake, and had been\\nup a while, so decided to take a nap until dinner time. It felt like I was lying\\nthere for only a couple minutes, but was told that I had been there an hour\\nwhen the dinner call came.\\n\\nTank Girl and I walked to McDonald\\'s, where we all bought many fine ham-\\nburgers at twenty-five cents each.  I could only eat four, though. Bishop_III\\njoined us there, and we also met up with Tourmaline and Finrod there, who\\ngave us a ride back, in Tourmaline\\'s poor car, which had been dented pretty\\nseverely by an asshole a while back.\\n\\nThe gang spent the evening chatting and ignoring the TV.  We saw Pickles on\\nthe mud and invited her over, and about half an hour later, Snag and Pickles\\nhad arrived.  Snag didn\\'t stay very long, but Pickles sure did.  She was a\\nvery cuddly, and yet at the same time somewhat reserved, person.  Pope_751\\nlatched on to her in full-force scam mode.\\n\\nHe was doing the nice guy routine though, so I didn\\'t think he\\'d make it.  I\\nthought he should have talked less and felt more.  I didn\\'t think to tell him\\nthis, though, as he was obviously enjoying himself, and my hands were\\nfinding Tank Girl again.\\n\\nThings began to melt and twist, like they usually do when I achieve the\\nsleep-deprived state.  At one point Finrod had Tourmaline and Pickles on his\\nbed, in no particular order.  Shortly after that I found Pope_751 had managed\\nto find his way in there, too.  Bishop_III and Tank Girl went to bed, so I laid\\nback on the couch and thought about things, letting my brain vegetate to\\nimages on the TV screen.\\n\\nI became half-conscious for a while.  I remember Finrod and Tourmaline going\\nto bed, Pope_751 and Pickles returning to the living room.  We discussed how\\nfirm her right nipple was, but her left one wasn\\'t, and as they were cuddled\\nat the side of the couch, I was able to reach over and confirm, yes, her right\\nnipple was quite firm.  So I told him that he just need to rub her left nipple\\nlike so, and I demonstrated, and she didn\\'t move to knock my hand way,\\nwhich I thought was neat. But any thoughts of a menage-a-trois faded as I\\ndrifted thru valleys of dreams and fantasies.\\n\\n<page break>\\n\\nTuesday, March 24th\\n\\n\\nSo, he continued to sweet-talk her, trying to figure out why she didn\\'t want\\nto go all the way.  For a while he played with her using his stuffed rabbit\\n(he always takes it on trips), shoving it in her crotch, saying \"FUCK DA\\nBUNNY\", which I thought was amusing. As the days went by later, though,\\n\"FUCK DA BUNNY\" grew to be a hilarious inside joke.\\n\\nThey did get to making out, so I guess all of the nice guy routine talk\\nworked for him after all.  This impressed me a lot.  It was also entertaining\\nbecause they thought I was asleep there on the couch, when I wasn\\'t,\\nentirely.\\n\\nAlthough I did fall asleep for a while, with a few random dream segments.  I\\nwas wandering through a mall, lost.  Then I escaped the mall, and shot my\\ngun at people who were chasing me, but the gun wouldn\\'t work right.  Finally\\nI got away from them, and found myself at some well-trimmed lawn, with\\nwater-sprinklers running, ka-chick, ka-chick, ka-chik.  I realized I was in a\\ndream at that point, and used my dream power to fly.  So I was floating\\nabove the lawn, watching the water sprinklers, listening to them, ka-chik,\\nka-chik, ka-chick, when I thought that they didn\\'t sound quite right.  This\\nbit of suspicion took me out of the dream state, but the sound continued.\\n\\nI continued breathing slowly so as not to alert the two on the floor that I had\\nawoken.  They didn\\'t notice.  Pickles was mostly undressed, and Pope_751 had\\nhis finger going in and out of her in the most sexual manner, rhythmatically,\\nmaking the noise I had heard.  Pickles just laid there, quietly.  After a few\\nminutes, he moved to her breasts, and fondled those for a while.  All I could\\nthink of at the time was, gee, there\\'s a cute naked girl on the floor.\\n\\nDiscussing this later with him, he told me that he had suspected that I was\\nawake, but wasn\\'t sure, and if I had made goofy faces at him, he would have\\ncracked up laughing.  Apparently the experience was kind of wacky for him,\\nas she wasn\\'t really into it.\\n\\nAnyway, they cooled off and redressed, and I slipped way under this time, not\\nawakening until way past dawn.  Blackbird was there doing breakfast things,\\nPope_751 and Pickles were snuggled up cutely on the floor.  When they awoke,\\nPickles left rather abruptly, and we didn\\'t see her again.\\n\\nThe morning went by listlessly; I wanted to play with Tank Girl some more,\\nbut she was in Bishop_III\\'s room sleeping next to him, and I couldn\\'t think of\\na way to get her out of there without waking him up.  Thus I concentrated\\ninstead on convincing Pope_751 that we really shouldn\\'t drive to Milwaukee\\nwithout getting the tire fixed, so he went out to fix it.  I watched Finrod and\\nTourmaline come in and leave, played some more Game Boy, and basically\\nvegged, thinking about Bishop_III, in utter confusion.  When Pope_751 re-\\nturned, after doing a couple errands, we discussed the possibility of hitting a\\nMilwaukee nightclub that night, and possibly making a side-trip to\\nUrbana-Champaign to visit cthonics, another mudder-type person.  We contact-\\ned him on DreamScape and got directions, and which included a 7-11 where\\none can get \"many fine slurpees\".\\n\\nPickles made a brief appearance on the mud, and she said was dead now, her\\nparents had found out that she was gone out all night. I couldn\\'t understand\\nthe problem, she is twenty years old, but apparently still firmly in the grip of\\nher parents.  I hate parents like that, and I think people over eighteen\\nshould move out and develop their own life.  Apparently she really was in\\ntrouble, though, as there hasn\\'t been any sign of her since then.\\n\\nPope_751 and I then went cruising around town again, and stopped by a\\nVon\\'s, where I bought postcards and CDs [see Appendix A], wondering why\\neven a little town like that had a good selection. With great effort I convinced\\nPope_751 to stop at a pizza joint, and my stomach stopped growling as I\\nchomped away.  My cohort didn\\'t eat much, and spent the time writing a letter\\nto one of his girlfriends.\\n\\nWhen we arrived back at the apartment, Tank Girl was awake and Bishop_III\\nwasn\\'t, which was an opportunity I just couldn\\'t pass up.  Quickly I hopped\\nonto the couch and commenced cuddling her all over again, breaking her\\nattention away from the computer.  Pope_751 did his part by convincing her\\nto let him take over at the keyboard. This allowed her get more intimate with\\nme, and so we did.  Things were going along merrily when Pope_751 tells us\\nthat the people on the mud wanted to get the show on the road, as we\\ndiscovered he was doing a play-by-play, and logging it this time.\\n\\n\"Okay,\" I said, \"I guess I\\'d better get the condoms out, then.\"\\n\\n\"I guess so,\" replied Tank Girl.\\n\\nRight.  Wow.  Meanwhile, Tourmaline was in the room too, fretting over\\nwhether to do Logic or Differential Equations homework, and I had the\\nopportunity to have sex, even though it meant there would be two people\\nwatching.\\n\\nIt was a simple decision, I didn\\'t even hesitate.\\n\\nIt went like yesterday, but more intense; she responded well to my bites on\\nthe neck, and quickly my pants were open, her dress was skirted up, and we\\nwere in business.  It was fast, yes, and I would have preferred a slow night\\nof nude snuggling in a warm bed, but such luxuries weren\\'t available at the\\ntime.  It was really intense, though, and we enjoyed ourselves.  And I even\\nremembered to use the condom!\\n\\nSo, we recovered after that, and I looked over the log, trying to figure out\\nwhether the people on the mud believed what was happening, and basically\\nfelt pretty happy overall.  Pope_751 figured out the way to get out of town\\nand we prepared to depart.  Bishop_III came around, and I got to sit there\\ncuddling Tank Girl, wondering if he knew what just went down, and what\\nwould happen when he found out, and so on.\\n\\nBut enough of that.  It was great, but Pope_751 was driving, and he said it\\nwas time to leave, so we blew, and kicked on down the road towards Urbana-\\n-Champaign.  While Pope_751 grumbled about the slow truck in front of him, I\\ngot a chance to lie back and ponder what just happened.  It\\'s not every year\\nI get this lucky, or whatever, so it was worth some thought.  It really had me\\nconfused, too.\\n\\nAfter a few interesting grain silos and miles of tedium, we were back on the\\nInterstate, and Pope_751 began to mellow out, listening to Rush Limbaugh on\\nhis low-tech radio.  A strange structure came into view, and I asked him what\\nit was.\\n\\n\"Oh, that?  That\\'s a farm.\"\\n\\n\"Ah.\"\\n\\nIt was a peaceful, quiet moment, perfect for reflection and consideration of the\\npuzzle I had before me.  My problem was that I suddenly felt that it had all\\nhappened to easily.  I began to wonder if there was a secret explanation\\nbehind it all, some ulterior motives that I hadn\\'t noticed.  Why had I succeed-\\ned here, when I had failed so many times before, elsewhere?  The scary\\nthought occurred to me that perhaps it was just a pity fuck, that she had\\nheard about all my angst-related problems, and wanted to give me a pleasur-\\nable experience, out of pity for me.  But the more I thought about this, the\\nmore it just didn\\'t seem right; I felt she was not acting out of pity, out of\\ncuriosity maybe, but not pity.  So I marked that idea off, there had to be\\nsome other reason.\\n\\n\"And that?  Is that a farm?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes.\"\\n\\n\"Imagine that, two farms in a row.\"\\n\\nSo my mind wandered over to stranger ideas.  Maybe someone else at Purdue\\nfelt sorry for me, and chose to make a present of Tank Girl to me, paying her\\na small fee.  I wondered who I knew there that would do something like that\\nfor me, and while I entertained a few ideas, I had to reject this train of\\nthought, as she really didn\\'t seem to be the type who would act as a\\nhired-out prostitute-type person. My mind was jumping among random guess-\\nes.\\n\\n\"Dude, look!\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"A farm!\"\\n\\n\"Whoaaa...\"\\n\\nPerhaps, then, she didn\\'t do it for pay, but as a favor.  Just to make my life\\na little bit brighter and more hopeful.  People have done me favors before,\\nalthough nothing like this.  Still, this didn\\'t seem right either, as I could\\nswear that she wouldn\\'t have done it with Bishop_III right in the next room\\nunless she had her own personal reasons, a more self-satisfying motive.  So\\nanother idea fizzled out because it just didn\\'t make any sense.\\n\\n\"Hey, is that another farm ahead?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes... I think so.\"\\n\\nI twisted Pope_751\\'s bunny\\'s ears and thought some more.  Could it have been\\na challenge?  A dare, perhaps?  Maybe someone told her she wouldn\\'t dare do\\nit, and the challenge was set, and she felt obligated to follow through with it.\\nBut who would make such a dare?  Well, truly, there a lot of obnoxious people\\nwho do that, just to see what kind of reaction could be evoked.  This didn\\'t\\nexplain the hints of action I was seeing on the mud during the weeks previ-\\nous to the trip, though; we had been joking about it for quite a while before\\nI had arrived.  In the end, I chose to shoot down this idea also.\\n\\n\"So, what\\'s that building, then?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, let\\'s see what it looks like when we get closer.\"\\n\\n\"Hmm.  It looks vaguely familiar.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes.  It\\'s a farm.\"\\n\\nSo maybe it was my charming good looks, my winning personality, my out-\\nstanding charisma... hell, maybe it was the beard.  Only in the past couple\\nmonths have I had a beard, which would explain why no one had noticed me\\nbefore, as I\\'ve been working nights for the past few months, not seeing\\nanyone in my daily life.  But the illusions of vanity only lasted for a few\\nminutes.  Sure, I was no longer the dweeby kid I used to be many years ago,\\nbut I\\'m no dashing heartthrob either.  It was fun to contemplate, though.\\n\\n\"And that thing over there?  Is that a farm?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I believe it is.\"\\n\\n\"What a coincidence, we just passed one a few minutes ago.\"\\n\\nHe nodded in agreement.\\n\\nFinally, it occurred to me that maybe she was simply a very horny individual,\\nand could not resist sex whenever it was offered.  I just happened to be in\\nthe right place at the right time.  Whee, I should be so lucky more often.\\nBut then I remember how she actually lived in a dorm, and chose to stay at\\nthe apartment the whole time I was there. Suddenly I realized it was no\\ncoincidence, it wasn\\'t just luck, that there was something beyond all that.\\n\\nAnother goddamn farm came into view.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t that a--\"\\n\\n\"YES!  IT\\'S ANOTHER FUCKING FARM!\"\\n\\n\"Thought so.\"\\n\\nBut we ran out of farms, and I ran out of time to ponder the reasons and\\nmotivations.  It wasn\\'t until about a week later that I had figured it all out;\\nthe results are left as an exercise for the reader.\\n\\nUrbana-Champaign was everything I dreamed it to be, and less. Our directions\\nto cthonics\\'s place were rather vague, as he had no car, and thus didn\\'t quite\\nunderstand what the freeways were, much less how to get to his apartment\\nfrom them.  But we prevailed anyhow.\\n\\nActually, Pope_751\\'s car needed gas and the 7-11 we stopped at happened to\\nbe the same 7-11 that was referenced in the directions.  So I bought slurpees,\\nand we made our way up to the third floor of some ancient slum.  This\\nstrange Kibo-like person answered our rapping at his door and it could only\\nbe cthonics, so I thrust the cherry slurpee upon him, forcing him to accept it.\\n\\nPope_751 collapsed on the couch, all those farms had really stressed him out.\\nSo we participated in casual conversation, and cthonics showed me a picture\\nof Claire\\'s breast, so I borrowed one of his pink crayons and drew a picture\\nof Claire\\'s left nipple and showed it around. Claire sure is a cutie, as I got to\\nsee a picture of her face, too. Hunger drove us into action and we decided to\\nwalk to the strip of restaurants in this thriving urban area, but it was very\\ndifficult deciding just where to eat.  We just wanted to walk up and down the\\nsidewalks all night long, but something broke our stride eventually, and we\\nate sandwiches at a pub-type of place.\\n\\nAfter that, I felt much better, but Pope_751 felt pretty dead.  We walked back\\nto cthonics\\'s pad, there being nothing else to do in Urbana-Champaign.  He\\neven made some references to Lemmings, though I didn\\'t get to see the actual\\ngame.  I convinced Pope_751 to hit the road, so we could make it to the\\nnightclub in Milwaukee he had mentioned earlier.  This got us back on the\\nroad.\\n\\nWe managed to get forty miles north of there when we stopped to pick up a\\nmap.  I knew if we kept heading north we\\'d have to run into a freeway\\nsooner or later, but Pope_751 was feeling a bit lost. Once we had the map I\\nrealized we had been parallelling the freeway by five miles this whole time.\\nOops.  I took over the driving, and Pope_751 whipped out a pillow and\\npromptly passed out asleep.  So I took the boat out of dock and headed it\\nback on course.\\n\\nIt was after sunset, and the farms and faded away into the darkness, when I\\nheard on the radio that Jerry Brown had won Connecticut. This shocked me,\\nand pleased me, as I really don\\'t want to see Clinton in office, I don\\'t even\\nwant him as the democratic candidate.  He just reminds me of the guy who\\nwon all the popularity contests in high school, Class President, Captain of the\\nFootball Team, and so on.  At least Brown has interesting, if wacky, ideas.\\nOur government does need major changes, though.\\n\\nI drove through Chicago, getting another beautiful taste of that skyline, all lit\\nup at night.  By the time we arrived in Milwaukee, Pope_751 had woken up\\nafter a restful four-hour nap.  I didn\\'t have any puzzling thoughts on that\\nleg of the trip, because I was vegging to talk/news radio the whole time.\\nThis mind candy was pretty restful for me, and I was ready and willing to\\nparty.  I didn\\'t even mind that the weather was below freezing, threatening to\\ncreate ice.\\n\\nWe dropped our luggage off at his house, in the basement where the comput-\\ner, stereo, and keyboards were.  It was quite an artistic little cave, with Sid\\nVicious posters and other cut-outs.  Even a few penguins were present.  But\\nwe didn\\'t stay long, and Pope_751 snatched his parents\\' car and we cruised\\ninto the Downtown area.\\n\\nPope_751 led me to Esoteria, the closest thing one could find to a\\nteenydoomerland on a Tuesday night.  It was a small place, with minimal\\nlighting effects, but at least they did play Skinny Puppy twice. I drank a\\ncouple long island iced teas there, which were mixed a lot stronger than I was\\nused to, though I didn\\'t notice until later.  Maybe I should avoid drinking\\nwhen I\\'m travelling.\\n\\nThere were a few babes there, but for the most part they were in couples,\\nwhich led us to watch and chat, and not really do anything else.  It was a\\ngreat way to unwind after being in a car for four hours, though.  I let the\\nalcohol kick in, so the visions would swim.\\n\\nAfterwards we drove back to the house, which wasn\\'t a short drive, and\\nPope_751 alternated tapes of his punk band\\'s music and his wacky remixes of\\npopular industrial bands.  It was quite a trip, especially with all the\\nstreetlights and funky Milwaukee landmarks zooming by. The city even had a\\nlittle skyline of its own, in miniature.\\n\\nAt the house we watched TV for a while, and I must have really been trip-\\nping, because I remember watching Perry Mason in the living room, and then\\nappearing downstairs in the cave, watching Pope_751 hit the local BBS/chat-\\nlines or maybe it was the muds.  Probably both.  After that blackout I chose\\nto do the sleep thing, and slipped into unconsciousness with a small, but firm,\\nthud.\\n\\nMany, many hours later, I woke up and showered, any effect of a hangover\\nlong gone.  There was a light snow on the ground, and it made me kind of\\nparanoid, so I played with the Game Boy for a while.  Then after Pope_751\\nwoke up, I got online and my boss caught me, so I chatted with him for a\\nwhile.  After reassuring him that the systems are doing fine and that I\\'d been\\nchecking them periodically, he let me go and I skimmed over email things.\\nThen Pope_751 logged into his chatline where he spat and cursed and said\\ngenerally hateful things, as per his character.\\n\\nOnce that was over with, we headed back out and went shopping for CDs near\\nthe downtown or university area.  I was impressed with the selection they had\\nthere, and bought even more CDs [see Appendix A] to add to my collection.  I\\nnever have the opportunity to buy these things at home, because the selection\\nin Tucson is limited.\\n\\nThat managed to kill a couple hours, and we drove back to the house,\\nlistening to more of Pope_751\\'s crazy custom remixes.  He played for me a\\nsong he was working on, \"Senator Jack Kennedy\", which existed as a program\\nin his PC.  His collection of keyboards and other music machines was all\\nlinked up MIDI-style with his computer, which gave him the power to create\\ninteresting things, even though his recording equipment was rather limited.\\n\\nHe got back on the chats and got in touch with one of the local girls, Penny,\\nand arranged for us to take her to go see the move movie \"Basic Instinct\".\\nIt was a bit of a rush, picking her up and getting to the theater on time, but\\nwe managed it.  Neither of us hit on her, too, which was amazing, considering\\nhow things on this trip had gone. The movie was entertaining, though the\\nstyle reminded me of \"Cape Fear\", which is to say that I thought it was over-\\n-acted and the camera footage over-dramatic, considering that the sex scenes\\nweren\\'t all that sexy, the violent scenes weren\\'t that impressive, and the\\nlesbian scenes were mere hints of what they could have been.  I felt like I\\nwas watching an edited-for-television version of a movie I hadn\\'t seen.\\n\\nAfterwards we plundered through the snow and ice to hang out with some of\\ntheir friends at this fundie\\'s house (excuse me, Protestant). I was interrogated\\nabout my political and religious beliefs, which left the religious wacko rather\\nconfused, since she respected how I supported Bush and the republican party,\\nbut frowned strongly on my devout atheism. I was informed that she\\'d pray\\nfor my soul.  Aw, gee.  Meanwhile the real action was with Penny and one of\\nthe other guys there, as they were for the most part pretending the other\\nwasn\\'t there, while at the same time striving to look natural and relaxed.  I\\nfound this amusing.\\n\\n<page break>\\n\\nThursday, March 26th\\n\\n\\nAround 1:30am we were told it was getting late and it was time to leave, which\\nwas fine with me, as I was bored with the whole affair by then.  We got back\\nin the car and drove away, and the conversation of course instantly picked\\nup with Penny talking about her boy problems. Well, she\\'s still pretty young,\\nI thought, excusable for being slightly immature.  Though it really nagged me\\nthat her problem was the most classic one that angst-ridden people have to\\ndeal with: she didn\\'t want to be romantic with this guy, but she didn\\'t want\\nto hurt his feelings, so she wanted get the point across to him of \"Let\\'s Just\\nBe Friends\".\\n\\nWell, I nearly puked right there, and within minutes I was telling her exactly\\nwhat I thought about that line of reasoning, where it will go, and how much\\npain she\\'ll cause by pursuing this course of action.  I rather doubt, though,\\nthat my opinions sunk into her shallow mind.  Sigh.  I guess she would learn\\nthe hard way, eventually.  Pope_751 seemed to think she was a very smart\\nperson, so maybe there\\'s hope.  I remain doubtful.\\n\\nAfter we dropped her off, it was back to the basic male-bonding experience:\\nplaying with music, reviewing CDs, and chatting with people via cyberspace,\\nbe it the local chatline or a mud like DreamScape.  My own mud was having\\nproblems, as usual.  Every time I leave town, the thing crashes.  When we\\nbored of all this, we went back to sleep for a while.\\n\\nWhen I woke up, there was a lot of snow on the ground, and it looked very\\nintimidating.  We got a very slow start to the day, and didn\\'t do very much.\\nEventually, in the evening, we drove out to the university, using the old boat,\\nsince a bigger car seems to be safer on ice.\\n\\nWe parked somewhere next to the campus, but it had been a while since\\nPope_751 had been there, as he was totally lost and refused to admit it.  We\\nwalked through several buildings, looking for richter\\'s office, who we were to\\nmeet for dinner.  Eventually, after a long walk through blowing wind and\\nheavy snow, we found ourselves at the student union, and became unlost.\\n\\nAfter that it only took a few minutes to find the lab that richter was watching\\nover.  She still had an hour to go, so after doing the introduction thing with\\nMarkian Gooley and Mark Lippert, a couple of people from talk.bizarre, I\\nemptied my mind by reading news, as the keyboards were too messed up to do\\nthe typing required for mudding. Mark Lippert, for those who are keeping\\nscore at home, was the total opposite of Roger David Carasso.  Totally differ-\\nent personalities there; I kept thinking of him as the \"anti-carasso\".\\n\\nAfter the hour was over, richter kicked people out of the lab, and we ran\\n(again through snow and ice, it was just getting colder) back to the car and\\ndrove over to her place, parking at Walgreen\\'s, because there was no parking\\nat her apartment building.  Fortunately it wasn\\'t a long walk.  The apartment,\\nhowever, was pretty small, and crowded, for she had acquired all of her\\ngrandmother\\'s antiques.  There wasn\\'t any room to walk around, you just had\\nto stand in the same spot the whole time.\\n\\nAfter several minutes of whining about her broken refrigerator, richter made\\nus dinner, which was chinese food, dumplings and rice and stuff like that.  It\\nwas enjoyable, but I\\'m not a big fan of chinese food, so wasn\\'t overly im-\\npressed.  I would have just gone out to eat, though I guess that\\'s an\\nexpensive luxury to some.\\n\\nAfter dinner Pope_751 and Mark Lippert took off; Markian and I spent the\\nnight there, unfolding the couch, rearranging the furniture, checking the\\nweather channel, and basically being boring.\\n\\n<page break>\\n\\nFriday, March 27th\\n\\n\\nIn the morning richter had to go to work for a few hours, which left Markian\\nand I with some hours to kill.  We walked around, confused, in the morning\\nsun, trying to find a diner to have breakfast at.  Most of the snow was\\nquickly melting away, which was quite a welcome relief. I was fairly paranoid\\nabout snow and ice, because two years previous to this trip, I\\'d had an auto\\nwreck on black ice in Wisconsin.\\n\\nEventually we did find a place, and I got to experience what corned beef hash\\nis.  It\\'s pretty rare out west, and was a new experience for me.  But a good\\nbreakfast makes for a good day, so I merrily chomped away.  I think I ate\\nbreakfast more than other meal while on this vacation, with lots of eggs.  I\\nlike eggs.\\n\\nAfter that we wandered back to the car and decided to kill some time down-\\ntown.  Markian\\'s driving was about as bad as a beginning Student Driver, and\\nit was miraculous that we didn\\'t have a wreck.  He ran through red lights,\\ndid left turns from the wrong lane, and generally made other people have to\\nswerve and slam brakes.  I made sure my seat belt was securely fastened and\\ntook comfort in the fact that he was driving a large american boat, and thus\\nwe would probably be safe in the event of a collision.\\n\\nFinally, after cutting off a city bus, we found a parking space, and it only\\ntook fifteen minutes to finish parallel parking.  We spent a couple hours\\nwalking around the downtown area, taking in the architecture and other\\nscenery.  There wasn\\'t much of a street society, though, and things were\\nactually rather quiet.  We killed time in a bookstore, visited Usinger\\'s so\\nMarkian could pick up some sausage, and watched a car squeal its alarm\\nendlessly.  There were several smokestacks, a structure I don\\'t see very\\noften.  I thought they had all been knocked down back in the seventies.\\nActually, parts of downtown Milwaukee were basically stuck in that decade,\\nwith very few signs of modern cars or technologies present.  Even the grade\\nschool looked ancient, several stories high with horizontally hinged windows.\\nWe also visited a museum, which had many items of historical interest,\\nincluding pictures and models describing Milwaukee as it had appeared in the\\npast.\\n\\nEventually we had killed our time, and hit the road again.  Luckily we were\\nnear the freeway, where Markian was a little better at driving.  We drove off,\\nin search of richter\\'s workplace.  It was easy to find, mostly because Markian\\nhad a city map, and I was able to translate richter\\'s hastily scribbled direc-\\ntions into something coherent.  We arrived a bit early, though, so stopped at\\nDenny\\'s and Markian had lunch.  I just ate some cole slaw. The menu at\\nDenny\\'s had special Lent selections, for the religious type of people to choose\\nfrom.  I didn\\'t think anyone paid mind to such silliness anymore, but Markian\\nand richter both did, I believe.\\n\\nI don\\'t get it.  Christ is *not* coming back, he\\'s very dead.  There is no god,\\nit\\'s just a story that the ancient governments invented to give the commonfolk\\nhope.  Oh well.  Luckily, usually it\\'s mostly harmless.\\n\\nWe entered richter\\'s workplace, and had the lady at the main desk give her a\\ncall to let us know we had arrived.  But even then we were told to wait.  I\\nshrugged, having had to wait all day, for this and that, and sat down on a\\nconvenient couch, and paged through a magazine.  A while later richter\\narrived and we got back on the road, after a moderate delay at the conve-\\nnience store.\\n\\nThe drive to Minneapolis wasn\\'t very eventful, either.  Our cruising speed was\\n67 mph, and I played a variety of CDs on richter\\'s jambox.  No one complained\\nabout the music, although the Current 93 CD was a bit tedious. The Enya and\\nSkinny Puppy CDs were very nice, though.  We passed through a part of the\\nstate where they were smashing up the Interstate with machines built for the\\nsole purpose of hitting the road like a hammer, shattering it.  Then other\\ncrane and scoop-like vehicles tore up the road, which  revealed that it had\\nsteel cables running through it.\\n\\nI didn\\'t know that the Interstates had steel running through them. And it was\\nsurprising to learn that they were completely removing and replacing the\\nroad, regularly.  Every year they tear up stretches of road and replace them.\\nWinter really kills those roads.  Back in the desert southwest, we have the\\nsame roads they put down forty years ago.  Every five to ten years we add a\\nlayer of blacktop to it, and that\\'s about it.  It just made me wonder even\\nmore why so many people choose to live so far north.\\n\\nAfter about four or five hours, we came to the New Richmond and River Falls\\nexits, and I came to the surprising realization that things were actually\\nbeginning to look familiar, from my visit to Wisconsin two years ago.  This\\ncomforted me greatly.  It didn\\'t last, though, as we were soon in Minneapolis,\\nwhich meant city driving, and things got scary again.  We weaved our way to\\nBrian\\'s apartment, as per the instructions I had been given, and it was quite\\na relief to get out of the car.  Finally, I could rest and be with old friends\\nand begin AngstCon III.\\n\\nBut it was not meant to be.  On Brian\\'s door was a map to Frang\\'s house,\\ninforming us to go there instead.  I sighed very deeply and cursed, but we\\ngot back in the car.  The instructions made sense for about the first half, but\\nafter that, they were vague and confused.  We got sidetracked and found\\nourselves several miles off course, so we backtracked and tried a second\\nattempt.  I decided to skip over the confusing part of the directions and tried\\nto match the later part of the directions to the city map.  We found one road\\nwe were supposed to be on, but we couldn\\'t find Elm street. Then there were\\nthese detour signs and road construction and we found ourselves in a dark\\nand twisted place.  Markian was rather confused, and richter and I were a bit\\nedgy from his driving, but I forced myself to concentrate, and logically figure\\nthings out.  I decided that as long as we headed in a certain general direc-\\ntion, we had to hit streets that made sense.  And so, after a few minutes\\nparked in a dark, desolate, and broken road, staring at a map, we ventured\\nforth and discovered a road that matched the city map.  We followed this until\\nwe hit a road near the end of Brian\\'s directions, basically counting numbered\\nstreets, and finally found Frang\\'s house.  To this day, I have no idea where\\nElm street is supposed to be.\\n\\nFortunately when we arrived, there were people present, familiar faces and\\nnew faces.  I hadn\\'t met Brian and Frang before, but it was quite obvious to\\nme who was who.  Harlan was there too, as was Anton, and the legendary\\nKrill-Man (TM).  I took an offered beer and drank heavily, trying to calm\\ndown and relax.\\n\\nI didn\\'t kill Brian.  I was informed, however, had we arrived earlier, that not\\nonly would we have found a map to Frang\\'s on Brian\\'s door, but there was\\nalso a map to Brian\\'s on Frang\\'s door.  I think, had I found this, someone\\nsurely would have had to die.\\n\\nSo I interrogated Frang until he surrendered the instructions to the nearest\\nconvenience store, and then grabbed Anton and pulled him out of there.\\nMarkian followed us.  I got to see Anton\\'s new car, a Geo, which surprisingly\\nhad legroom.  I had heard good and bad things about the Geo line, but had\\nnever been in one before.  Overall, it\\'s a good little car, better than I had\\nexpected.\\n\\nWe drove to the store, looking for the large neon MILK sign, which we found\\neasily.  Finding a parking spot was a little more challenging. I didn\\'t care; it\\nwas good to be with Anton again.  I walked the aisles of the convenience\\nstore, looking post-it notes, or several small objects. What I found was a bag\\nof fifty old-style (no spring, just one piece of wood) clothespins.  So I got\\nthose, and a heavy marker to write notes on the wood.  I was pleased.  I was\\nready to return to the house.\\n\\nAnton and ricther fell in love with a large bubble-maker, while we all chatted\\nand smiled and generally behaved jovially social.  Frang\\'s housemate made an\\nappearance, and boy was she a hot babe.  I think having someone like that as\\na housemate would be quite a distraction, but I could sense that Frang was\\nentirely comfortable with it.  Hi Ho Silver\\'s flight was cancelled thanks to a\\nstupid fuck-up with United Airlines, and wouldn\\'t be in until the next\\nmorning.\\n\\nThere were two cats in the house, which richter promptly scared off, yelling\\nand running at them.  Then she whined because they were afraid of her.  I\\njust shook my head.  When she wasn\\'t watching, the rest of us managed to\\nmake peace with the cats.  As the night went on, Anton blew hundreds of\\nlarge bubbles, getting soap all over the floor.  We talked at some length about\\nbubbles, particularly their interesting psychedelic patterns of color.\\n\\nFor a little while I got Frang alone upstairs, and grabbed some access.  Then\\nhe checked the status of a large model he was running an FFT on.  I felt in-\\nstantly envious of his job, because he got to use some mathematical code.\\nThough, as he pointed out, the difference between us was that I actually\\nunderstood the mathematics behind the operation.  This made me feel a little\\nbetter, and so I played with some of Frang\\'s puzzles, of which he had many.\\n\\nIt got late, and Harlan, Anton, Brian and the many thousands of krill took off,\\nwhile the rest of us found sleeping arrangements in the house.  Frang carted\\nup furniture to the spare bedroom on the second floor, and we turned into it\\na sea of sleeping bags.  We didn\\'t stay up all night talking, though; just shut\\nthe light and went to sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n<page break>\\n\\nSaturday, March 28th\\n\\n\\nMarkian woke up very early, but I could tell nothing was happening, so I\\nchose to sleep the morning away.  When I finally came around, the house was\\nall quiet, which gave me the opportunity to draw faces on the clothespins and\\nhide a few.  Most of the people were gone, to pick up Hi Ho Silver at the\\nairport.\\n\\nI had only hidden a couple clothespins when they arrived, and it was really\\ngreat to see Silver again.  And then a short while later, Anton arrived with\\nAriel, and we all greeted her with a very warm reception. We then all drove\\nover to Brian\\'s apartment, and he was actually there this time.\\n\\nFinally, everyone was present at AngstCon III!  Our first scheduled event was\\nat a pizza place that was supposed to have spectacular pizza, but there was a\\ncatch: Brian had chosen it.  The only good thing I can say about it is that\\nthe drive to the place took us down a road that had some very interesting\\nlarge houses.  It was like a mile-long row of small mansions.  Out west all the\\nreally nice houses are hidden in the foothills and surrounded by acres of\\nland.  But here, we had some really nice houses, arranged as if it were just\\nanother part of suburbia, which I found very amusing.\\n\\nThe pizza place, however, was ridiculously crowded.  We could have guessed\\nat this by the fact that all the parking in the area was taken up. I thought\\nwe would have been better off going, well, almost anywhere that wasn\\'t\\ncrowded.  Pizza is pizza, but being able to talk with your friends in a\\ncomfortable setting is very important, especially when you only see them only\\nonce every year or two.  But we ate, two slices each, oh boy.\\n\\nThen we drove to the zoo.  I couldn\\'t figure out what the appeal of a zoo was\\nsupposed to be, but most of the other members were keen on the idea.  I\\nthought it was dumb, but then, I didn\\'t even enjoy zoos back when I was a\\nsmall child.  What can I say?  They\\'re boring.  Well as it turned out, this zoo\\nwas just about ready to close when we arrived, and the weather was all very\\ngray and cold, beginning to snow.  It occurred to me that this AngstCon was\\nnot very well planned, and that Brian was actually a bozo, who, though he\\nmeant well, was making a mess of things.\\n\\nSo, I regained some control, convinced him that we should go to the CD store\\nnext, and got the instructions from him.  Then I got in Anton\\'s car with\\nrichter, Silver, and Ariel in the back seat.  Silver really enjoyed that!  Anton\\neven became jealous of the whole situation after a while. But it was great,\\nhaving the five of us in the car together, and the rest of the universe could\\ngo to hell.  There was nothing like having old friends you haven\\'t seen in a\\nyear or two, comfortably close together, cruising down the road.\\n\\nWe made it back downtown again, and spent a while in the CD store there.\\nOne of the girls on the staff was a teenydoomer type, which everyone noticed\\nand thought I should hit on her.  I didn\\'t think she was that special, though.\\nAriel asked me for a suggestion on which CD she should buy, so I told her to\\nget one by Dead Can Dance.  Silver was finding many amusing album covers,\\nand I managed to find even more CDs to buy.  [See Appendix A]\\n\\nSince we were downtown, I figured I might as well find out what the Glam\\nSlam was like, since my brother is a major Prince fanatic.  It was a few\\nblocks away, in cold snowy air, and the place was closed.  But I took pictures\\nof the outside of it anyhow, to send to my brother, so he could be insanely\\njealous.\\n\\nAfter that, we ventured onto Minneapolis\\'s Skyway, a most interesting and\\nmodern idea.  The skyscrapers all had shops in their first two floors, and one\\nyear, long ago, someone connected two of them with an insulated walkway.\\nThis idea caught on rapidly, and now all of the skyscrapers in Minneapolis are\\nconnected with these insulated walkways.  So it makes a sort of an expanded\\nmall, although, as we discovered, some of the walkways have limited access.\\nOne area was even closed off because they were filming a movie there.\\n\\nSome of us were getting thirsty, and others wanted to find a restroom, so we\\nasked Frang to lead us to one of these.  He nodded and led us on, through a\\nskyway and into an upscale retail store called \"Dayton\\'s\". In here he led us\\naround clothes and hats and down an escalator, and then finally we arrived at\\na fresh produce center.  I found myself staring at pineapples, wondering\\nwhere the restroom was, where the drinks were, and just why the hell we had\\nbeen led to pineapples.\\n\\nIt was time to exert some control again.  I asked Anton if he knew anywhere\\nin this convoluted setup that might have drinks and restrooms, and was\\nfinally able to get him to admit that there was indeed a Burger King. (There\\nwere a few other suggestions from other people, but I had noticed that many\\nstores were closing up, and I knew Burger King would remain open for a\\nwhile, so I basically ignored everyone else.)  I commanded him to lead on, and\\nin a few minutes, we were at Burger King.  Many of us let out a large sigh of\\nrelief.\\n\\nAfter that we decided to head back to the cars, and Brian was leading again.\\nThis put us staring at dead end sections of skyway, closed off hallways, and\\nsecurity guards who weren\\'t sure of what advice to give.  Anton and I\\'d had\\nenough, and took off running down a darkened hallway.  Everyone else chose\\nto stay with the group.  We ducked into an alcove where there were elevators,\\nand jumped in one.  Anton quickly pressed the Close Door button, saying,\\n\"We\\'ve got to get away from those people.\"  I just nodded in agreement, with\\nan insane smile.  We ran outdoors and across the street, into a more open\\nsection of the skyway, and while Anton perused a map, I took a gander at an\\nawesome babe in leather.  It Anton a while to figure out what I was panting\\nat, but when he did, he asked me if I was going to invite her to dinner.\\n\\nI just smiled at him, and thought of the group we were with, and told him no.\\nNot the right time, not the right environment.  It was tempting, though,\\nbecause she did look hot.\\n\\nThen we were walking through skyways and we got sidetracked a couple\\ntimes, being just a little bit lost, but having lots of fun.  Eventually, we made\\nit to the car, and relaxed.  It took the others about half an hour to catch up\\nwith us, for they had taken an even more circuitous route than we had.  I\\ncouldn\\'t believe Brian had actually lived in this area for any period of time,\\nbut he supposedly had.\\n\\nSo, thinking of the pineapples, we decided we wouldn\\'t follow Brian to the\\nrestaurant we were to go for dinner, and Anton got Brian to tell him and\\nscribble out a crude map of where it was.  We recaptured Ariel, Silver, and\\nrichter, put them in the back seat, and took off into the snow.  We became\\nimmediately lost.  I couldn\\'t even tell which direction we were going.\\n\\nThe best part about this was that we didn\\'t even care.  It was just too great\\nto be together in the car again, and we all had a merry time, talking away,\\nwhile Silver did the cuddly-tickly thing with the two girls in the back seat,\\nmaking Anton envious all over again.  Eventually we found a major highway\\nand were able to manage to find our way to the restaurant, about an hour\\nlate.\\n\\nThe restaurant was a manchurian chinese place, with a buffet, so you had to\\nwalk downstairs to get your food, and carry it back up.  I thought this was\\npretty inconvenient, especially considering that I knew the price would be\\nrather high.  As the two groups of five took turns going downstairs for food,\\nthe others rearranged the seating arrangements.  We did it first, so the five\\nof us could sit together, and then they did it second, to switch ends of the\\ntable with us.  The food wasn\\'t bad, I rather enjoyed it, though some people\\ndidn\\'t, particularly richter, who spent most of the dinner downstairs on the\\nphone, making alternative travel arrangements back to Milwaukee, so she\\nwouldn\\'t have to drive back with Markian.\\n\\nAfter dinner we recollected back at Brian\\'s place, and I hid several clothes-\\npins in his apartment.  We spent an hour there watching richter and Brian\\nput his stereo system together, which wasn\\'t overly interesting.  I made\\nmyself useful by inspecting a line noise problem on his phone line, and de-\\nclared it to be the fault of a bad wire, after some testing.  I managed to find\\nenough wire to hook up his modem and phone, though, so he was able to use\\nthose, but not until later that night.\\n\\nEventually Ariel was about to panic with boredom, and we could hardly blame\\nher, and Anton ordered all of us out, to go find ice cream. Everyone stamped-\\ned out of the place, but I managed to stop them on the porch and get a plan\\nset up.  Of course, we didn\\'t follow the plan, we ended up somewhere else\\nanyway, but it was an ice cream parlor.\\n\\nWe made our way to the back of the place, where we took over a room\\nreserved for children\\'s parties.  Again, the five of us at one table, and the\\nother five at another.  Krill-Man, out of tradition, bought everyone ice cream,\\nand he asked me if he would always be the one that had to do it, and I\\nreassured him that I would take over the tradition once I made a higher\\nsalary than him.  This may be a while, because he currently makes more than\\ntwice what I do.\\n\\nThe ice cream, of course, was delicious.  I made everyone an official AngstCon\\nIII clothespin, which people clipped onto lapels and such.  Someone found\\nsome crayons, and we all began scribbling on the placemats, making very\\ninteresting pictures, ranging from Ariel\\'s violent surrealism to Anton\\'s\\nthought-provoking abstraction.  I drew a severed hand.\\n\\nAfterwards, we drove back to Brian\\'s, but only richter and I entered the\\napartment.  I explained to Brian that we were going to take Jill home, and\\nthat we would go directly to Frang\\'s afterwards.  Then richter explained to\\nMarkian that she wouldn\\'t be returning with him.  I tried to keep it as quick\\nand to the point as possible; soon we were back on the road.\\n\\nThe drive to Jill\\'s place was about thirty miles, so we all got to be happy and\\nchat all over again.  It was sad to see her go.  She had explained that she\\nwas unable to join in Sunday\\'s activities, so we hugged her goodbye and then\\ndrove back to Frang\\'s house, pleasantly and peacefully having a conversation\\namong friends.\\n\\n<page break>\\n\\nSunday, March 29th\\n\\n\\n\\nAs we clambered up the stairs to the guest bedroom, we saw Frang\\'s\\nhousemate again, she had come out of her bedroom, drawn by the noise, I\\nguess. She was wearing nothing but a red robe, and I quickly took in her\\nsensual features, from her bare feet to her rounded calves to the inviting\\ncleavage and welcoming, sleepy smile.  We talked for a while, I mean not just\\nme and her, but all of us, standing in the hallway.  I rather wanted to follow\\nher into her bedroom and trip the light fantastic, but again, I was guest of\\nFrang\\'s, and that might have been rather rude, so I skipped it.\\n\\nLater, I was informed by Frang that she wanted to know if I was always that\\nshy.  That rather shook me up.  I now have to wonder if I have finally\\nmanaged to acquire some sex appeal, for it seems too incredible to be true.\\n\\nAnyway, we all dived into the sea of sleeping bags once more and got some\\nrest.  In the morning it took a while to cycle people through the shower, so\\nSilver and I chased richter around in our underwear, tickling her, and\\ngenerally being pests.  Anton took advantage of this opportunity and clicked\\noff a shot with his camera, and I am sure richter wishes she could burn the\\nnegatives.  She yelled and cursed when the flash went off, it was most\\namusing.\\n\\nThen we all packed in Markian\\'s car to go to breakfast, but the first restau-\\nrant we went to wasn\\'t serving breakfast that late, so we had dessert instead,\\nmy treat.  After that we drove to a different restaurant and waited for a half\\nhour or more for seating, but were finally rewarded with a breakfast menu in\\nthe afternoon.  I ordered eggs, of course.\\n\\nFrang called up Brian\\'s apartment to figure out what that group was planning,\\nand we were told to visit the spoon.  Actually, this turned out to be an art\\nmuseum with rather large outdoor exhibits, one of which included a spoon\\nabout forty feet long, with a cherry on it.  There were several other sculp-\\ntures there, too, which kept us browsing through the area for over an hour.\\nWe didn\\'t see Brian\\'s group there, though.\\n\\nWhen we drove back to Frang\\'s house, and got out of the car, Brian\\'s car\\ndrove up.  Krill-Man (TM) jumped out, yelled, \"Bye!  Bye! Bye!\" and he\\nhopped around and hugged everyone, and then jumped back in the car, which\\nthen zoomed off to the airport.  I believe he was cutting it rather close.\\n\\nSilver\\'s flight and mine were ten minutes apart, and we had plenty of time to\\nget to the airport.  We hung out at the house for a while, and I hid a few\\nmore clothespins.  It got dull, so we moseyed on down the road to airport,\\nand I got a ride in Frang\\'s CRX finally.  In the car he had some pictures of\\nmy hero, Vice President Dan Quayle, from the time that he visited Cray, where\\nFrang works.\\n\\nSilver and I checked our baggage and then we explored the bookstore and\\ngift shop in the middle of the airport.  I picked up some reading material,\\nincluding a Waldo spoof called \"Find Dan Quayle\".  I had to grab it and run\\naway to keep the others from pointing out where he was on every page, for\\nthey had seen it before.  After that we had lunch at Pizza Hut Express, yay,\\npersonal pan pizzas.  A fitting last meal for the end of a fun vacation.\\n\\nThe trip back home was uneventful, with a ninety-minute layover at the DFW\\nairport.  I spent most of the flight reading Business Week and the Wall Street\\nJournal, as I wasn\\'t in the mood to concentrate on the whole Tank Girl thing,\\nwhich occupied my thoughts for a long period afterward.  It was almost\\nmidnight when I touched down in Tucson, and within an hour I was back in\\nthe office, catching up on work.\\n\\nIt was a great trip, and surely the most eventful vacation I\\'ve ever had.  The\\nexpenses came in a little under budget, since I had set some money aside for\\nbus fares, had that been necessary.  I met many people for the first time that\\nI\\'ve known for years via the computer nets, and got to see some people who I\\nhadn\\'t seen since previous AngstCons.  I got to experience what city life is\\nlike in some major cities, giving me more to compare and contrast with Los\\nAngeles and New York City.  I became closer to some people, and done things\\nthat I have never done before.  It was a very educational, growing experi-\\nence, and well worth it.\\n\\n    -- Xibo\\n\\n\\n\\n<page break>\\n\\nAppendix A, list of cd\\'s bought, deleted because I felt like it\\n\\nAppendix B, Airport protocol:\\n\\nBefore you commence your trip, be sure that the person who is picking you\\nup at the airport knows the airline, flight number, and arrival time of your\\nflight.  It may help to confirm the date and airport, especially if the city\\nyou\\'re going to has more than one popular airport.\\n\\nTravelling is a hectic, sometimes scary experience, and can be very frustrat-\\ning.  Thus, there is nothing more encouraging than seeing a familiar face at\\nthe gate when you disembark the plane.  If at all possible, the person picking\\nyou up should arrange to be at the gate.\\n\\nNote that if you arrive and there is no one there, you are expect to proceed\\nto the baggage claim area.  This will always take you through the security\\ncheckpoint, although in some airports there are many of these to choose from.\\nMeeting a person at a security checkpoint might work if they can\\'t get past it\\n(for whatever reason), but this method should not be depended upon unless\\nthere is only one possible security checkpoint that you could come out of, like\\nin smaller airports.\\n\\nAt the baggage claim area you will wait and get your luggage. If your ride is\\nnot here either, you must assume they are late; it may be wise to give a\\nphone call at this point, to see if your ride has left the house yet.  A really\\ncaring person will leave a message on the answering machine saying, \"Don\\'t\\npanic!  I\\'m on my way to the airport!  Wait by the baggage claim area!\"  This\\nis a good place to wait, as it is unique to your flight, and it is indoors, shel-\\ntered from rain, snow, heat, or whatever miserable weather there might be.\\nPlus, outside, you\\'ll not know where to meet the person.\\n\\nArranging to meet elsewhere should be done with the utmost care.  Parking\\nlots are bad, because they are so big.  Restaurants can be misleading, because\\nmost airports have more than one place that looks like you can get food there.\\n\\nWith some simple advance planning, with consideration and patience on both\\nsides, and contingency plans, you should never have to worry about being\\nstuck in an airport of some strange city, alone with no friends in sight.\\n\\nWeird News Volume Nine\\n\\nA PLATEFULL OF SMOG?\\n\\n-  Scientists at the California Institute of Technology reported\\nrecently that the hydrocarbons and other particulates released\\nwhen meat cooks accounts for one-fifth of the total particulates\\nin the air in Los Angeles -- more than is accounted for by either\\ngasoline of diesel engines.\\n\\nBAD MOVES\\n\\n-  Tampa, Florida, school officials invited inmate Edward\\nMcIntyre, serving 90 years for kidnapping and assault, to a local\\nhigh school to make an \"inspirational speech\" to students for Law\\nDay.

Trible, Jr.  (Virginia) has\\nhis way, the FBI may be watching when you log onto THE NATIONAL SATIRIST.\\n\\n  According to the Washington Post, Sen.  Trible has introduced a bill that\\ncalls for federal monitoring of contacts that personal computer users make with\\nelectronic bulletin boards which carry \"offensive material.\" Clearly, in some\\neyes, that would include THE NATIONAL SATIRIST.\\n\\n  Sen.\\tTrible got started with a well-intentioned premise:  he\\'d heard that\\nsome kiddy porno producers and buyers use BBSs to list their sicko products.\\nFollowing the one-rotten-apple-in-the-barrel guideline, he has introduced\\nlegislation that could have most of us PC users in varying degrees of hot water.\\n\\n  Why, there is hardly a BBS around that doesn\\'t have something on it that\\nsomeone will find offensive.  You should have heard my accountant\\'s reaction\\nwhen I told him he\\'d been replaced by downloaded a tax program.  Ditto the fast\\ntalking mortgage-broker who didn\\'t realize that I can run off those 30 year\\namortization charts, too.  (\"And the difference is ONLY a quarter of a percent\\nmore!) Can you imagine how some federal BBS investigator\\'s knee will jerk the\\nfirst time he scans through some of the personal messages exchanged among\\nconsenting adults?\\n\\n  Even the huge database services like CompuServe, Dialog, and Lexis/Nexis won\\'t\\nbe immune to charges of carrying \"offensive material\" if Trible\\'s dribble\\nbecomes law.  While you are online with CompuServe, GO HSX (Human Sexuality) and\\nlook around a bit.  Why, if J.\\tEdgar was still around, he would have blushed\\nfirst -- probably spent an hour online -- then sent in a SWAT team.  If you want\\nto see something REALLY offensive, pull up Federal Register Abstracts on Dialog\\nand read the price tags on some of the pork barrel military procurements in Sen.\\nTrible\\'s state, or pop over to Lexis and be offended by the proliferation of\\nlegal actions that seem to do no one but the attorneys any good.\\n\\n  As soon as I upload this column I am going to write off for some offensive\\nmaterial ...  a copy of Senator Trible\\'s proposed bill.  You may want one, too.\\nDrop a note to the Judiciary Committee, U.S.  Senate, Washington, DC 20510.

They are all uttered by one of my\\nco-workers.  He has achieved legend status within our group and it has become\\na game to pick up on the next fractured phrase. They are all malapropes, mixed\\nmetaphor, spoonerisms or some twist of this kind. I think he is an unconscious\\ngenious.  We catch ourselves uttering our own now and don\\'t know whether they\\nare a universal plague on the language or he has affected only his immediate\\nsurroundings. There have been lot\\'s we\\'ve missed I\\'m sure, but here is a short\\nlist of his best one\\'s.  They are in no order except a loose chronological\\none. I have placed translations beside them to lend some aid in understanding\\nwhen taken out of context.\\n\\n\\tI post them here for your enjoyment.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNoel@reg.triumf.ca\\n\\n================================================================================\\n                                T.
